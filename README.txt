Project Name: Snake Game
Creator: Diego Becerra

This is a GUI windows desktop application created using WPF that allows for users to play the 
classic Snake game. I used "The complete WPF tutorial" (see resoruces below) as a guide for the 
WPF concepts used to create this appliction, as well as a guide for the Snake game itself. 
Many aspects of the Snake game were adopted from this resource but I also added many additional features, 
including bug-fixes for edge cases and quality of life enhancements. This application is not intended 
for commercial use and is only intended as a personal development project and introduction to WPF.

Functionality:
 - Press SPACE key to start a new game
 - Snake direction can be controled using arrow keys, or alternatively WASD keys
 - Gain points by directing the snake to eat the red food
 - Game over when snake collision is detected
 - Press SPACE during an active game session to end the game
 - When a top 5 score is achieved, user is prompted to enter their name and
 their highsore is added to the highscore list
 - View top 5 high scores by navigating with GUI buttons
 - Press SPACE on high score list screen to return to welcome screen
 - Current score and snake speed visible in title bar
 - Speed of the snake speeds up as the score increases
 - User can delete all saved high score game data from high score list screen
 - User cannot lose the game by overloading multiple direction keys
 - User can select the QUIT button from title bar at any time to close the application
